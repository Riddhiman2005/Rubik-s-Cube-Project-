\begin{abstract}
   The \Tthree cube is the subject of numerous works and is examined several times as a group \cite{JC,TD,DDJT,DJ,RMG,TR}. Not only that, 
The \textit{God's Number} (the maximum required number of rotations of the optimal solution path) is the subject of many works and has often been calculated and improved by new algorithms \cite{Godgrol,salkinder2021n,RMG,Hu,TR,doi:10.1137/120867366,MMFAA}. 
The calculation of the \textit{God's Number} of the \Tthree cube is much more demanding and therefore also more interesting than that of the \Ttwo cube. The motivation of this work is to apply the knowledge of the \Tthree cube in \Ttwo cube. In contrast to the \Tthree cube, the \Ttwo cube has fewer pieces and no edge cubies - this makes the smaller cube less complex. However, the \Ttwo cube can be rotated due to the lack of center cubies, which means that the top side can be changed at will. In this work, the knowledge of the group of the \Tthree cube is adapted and thus the \Ttwo cube is represented using group theory to gain knowledge about the cube which includes calculating the number of possible cube configurations and creating a concept for finding the optimal solution path.

\section{Introduction}
Rubik's Cube \footnote{These few texts and articles give us some glimpse into the history and popularity of rubik's cube \cite{pekonen2021cubed, demaine2011algorithms,2018ChJME..31...77Z,bandelow1982inside,Hofstader,singmaster1980notes} }, designed by Ern\H{o} Rubik, is a $3D$ permutation puzzle \cite{wong2010group}. The concept of Rubik's Cube is thought to be originated from the Chinese Luo book that can be simplified into a zero-dimensional $3^{rd}$ order cube called Jiugong Map \cite{2018ChJME..31...77Z}.

\begin{definition} Certain configuration that has to be formed by the combination of $n^2$ numbers, i.e. {$1,2,3,..., n^2$} numbers in n-order square that makes the sum of the numbers in each row, column and two diagonal lines a constant value. That constant is called the \textbf{magic square constant} \cite{zen} and is given by $$\boxed{\frac{n(n^2+1)}{2}}$$
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Magic Square Constant for 2 - order cube: 5
    \item Magic Square Constant for 3 - order Cube : 15
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Permutation Puzzle}
\label{PP}
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{permutation puzzle} is a one-person game that follows the properties \cite{wong2010group} : 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Depending on the structure of the puzzle for some $n>1$, each move leads to a unique puzzle position \footnote{Puzzle Position is defined as an element in set generated by all possible legal moves.}, so, the function $f: \text{moves} \Rightarrow \text{Puzzle Positions}$ is a bijective mapping in $P= 1,2,...,n$.
        \item Each move must be invertible, that for some move $M$, $\exists$ $M^{-1}$ that restores the puzzle to the position it was before the move $M$ was performed. 
        \item If $f_1(M_1)=P_1$ and $f_2(M_2)=P_2$, then either $M_1 \mathlarger{\scriptstyle*}M_2$ [performing moves in sequence] is not a legal move or corresponds to the permutation of function composition ${f_1} \mathlarger{\scriptstyle*}{f_2}$ 
        
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}






There are many more interesting readings and paper on origin of permutation (combinatorics) puzzles \cite{BIGGS1979109} and history of Rubik's cube \cite{pekonen2021cubed}. We'll now dive more into \Ttwo cube and \Tthree cube now. 


\section{Terminology and Basic Features}
\fbox{\textbf{\Ttwo Cubes}} \\

Also called \textbf{Pocket Cube}, the cube is made up of eight smaller cubes.
In Figure \ref{Figure_CubeUnsolvedSolved}, it can be seen on the left in the twisted state and on the right in the solved state. 
In the starting configuration (also basic position, initial position) of the \Ttwo cube, each side has four coloured areas of the same colour.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption[Unsolved and Solved \Ttwo cube]{Unsolved and Solved \Ttwo cube}
\label{Figure_CubeUnsolvedSolved}
\end{figure}
\fbox{\textbf{\Tthree Cubes}}\\

Much popular than the \Ttwo cube  is the \Tthree cube. It consists of 27 small cubes [26 of them are visible, and $27^\text{th}$ cube [cubie] doesn't exist actually]. 
\newpage
In Figure \ref{Figure_3erCube} it can be seen unsolved on the left and in the starting configuration on the right.

\caption[Unsolved and solved \Tthree cube]{Unsolved and solved \Tthree cube}
\label{Figure_3erCube}
\end{figure}

\fbox{\textbf{$n\times n \times n$ Cube}}\\

It is an extension of \Tthree cube which takes the form of $n\times n \times n$ cube made out of $1 \times 1\times 1$ pieces and each $n\times n \times 1$ is free to rotate around its center.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Terminology}


 \begin{definition}
        The individual small cubes that make up a cube are \textbf{Cubies}.
        
    \end{definition}
    \textbf{Example: } 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \Ttwo cube has 4 cubies in each face.
        \item The \Tthree cube has 9 cubies in each face.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
 \begin{definition}
     Each cubies has one, two, three visible faces called \textbf{facelets}.
 \end{definition}

 \begin{note}
 Based on the no of facelets in case of \Tthree cube, cubie can be divided into \textit{centre-cubie: One facelet}, \textit{edge-cubie: two facelet} and \textit{Corner-Cubie}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Type of Cubie} & \textbf{Facelet(s)} \\
\hline
\textit{Centre-Cubie} & One facelet \\
\hline
\textit{Edge-Cubie} & Two facelets \\
\hline
\textit{Corner-Cubie} & Three facelets \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
 
 \end{note}
 
 \begin{definition}
        The space where the cubies reside is \textbf{Cubicle}. 
    \end{definition}

\begin{note}
   \textbf{Cubies vs Cubicles:} Cubicles are named the same way as cubies but represent the positions in space where the cubies reside rather than the physical blocks, If the cubie is solved, then \textbf{each cubie resides in the cubicle} that has the same name as it. When moves are applied to the cube, cubies can move and occupy other cubies but the cubicles are fixed in space \cite{wein2011mathematics}.
\end{note}
    \begin{definition}
        The positions occupied by facelets are called \textbf{slots}.
    \end{definition}
    
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{state of the cube} is a bijection mapping 
    $$\boxed{
\text{\{facelets\}} \xrightarrow{\cong} \text{\{slots\}}
}$$
\end{definition}
  In case of \Tthree cube, there are 54! states \cite{anu}. And, in case of \Ttwo cube, there are 24! states. 

\[\centering
\boxed{\textbf{So, to generalize for } n \times n \times n \text{ cube, we've } $6n^2$ ! \text{states.}}
\]

\begin{definition}
    The initial arrangement of the Rubik's Cube where each face is has a solid colour and each facelet belongs to one and only one face is the Starting / Initial configuration. \end{definition}


\subsection{Basic Feature of Rubik's Cube} 
\subsubsection{Symmetry Characteristic}
In mathematics, the concept of symmetry is described and explained by group theory. 
If an operation executed on a system transforms the system from one state to another state, and the two states are equivalent, then the system is symmetric to this operation.

Rubik’s cube has axial symmetries of four orders, two orders
, and three orders and is symmetric about the body center at the same time \cite{Hu,singmaster1980notes}.


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Symmetry.png}
\caption{The axial symmetries of (a) four orders, (b) two orders, and (c) three orders in Rubik’s cube. [Source: \cite{Hu}]}
\label{symm}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Combinatorial Characteristics}
Every state of the Rubik’s cube, whether solved or scrambled, can be achieved by rotating consecutively the six faces of the cube in solved position in finite steps, and can be restored by rotating the faces back step by step. The calculation which I'll be doing here is pretty simple \footnote{There are some nice explanations and discussions in \cite{hoda2010finding, animesh2018calculating, JC, 2018ChJME..31...77Z}}. 


\textbf{The puzzle was originally advertised as having over 3,000,000,000 combinations but only one solution}. Even Ern\H{o} Rubik mentioned in his autobiography: "\textit{It was as if I were staring blankly at a secret code, which I had created but could not penetrate}".
Depending on how combinations are counted, the actual number is significantly higher.
The original \Tthree Rubik's Cube has eight corners and twelve edges. There are $8!= 40,320$ ways to arrange the corner cubes. 
And $12!$ ways to arrange the edge cubies. Each corner cubie has 3 possible orientations, so $3^8$ ways of orienting the corner cubies and each edge cubies has 2 possible orientations, so $2^{12}$ possibilities of orienting the edge cubies, total nunmber of possible permutations  is

$$\boxed{8! \times 12!\times 3^8 \times 2^{12} \approx 5.19 \times 10^{20}}$$

This huge number has both valid and invalid configurations. I've discussed this in detail in Section \ref{Chapter_ValidConfigurations}. 

We've to find the number of valid configurations. 
So, for that we know each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; the orientation of the $8^\text{th}$ corner depends on the preceding seven, giving $3^{7}= 2,187$ possibilities.
There are $12!/2 (239,500,800)$ ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation \cite{Hu}.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving $2^{11}= 2,048$ possibilities \cite{wong2010group}.\\

\begin{center}
    $\boxed{8! * 3^{7} * \frac{12!}{2} * 2^{11}  = 43,252,003,274,489,856,0000}$
\end{center}
which is approximately $43$ quintillion.
Given any one of
the 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 states, it is possible to return to the solved state in 20
moves or less! That’s why 20 is called God’s Number [Discussed in section \ref{God}].
\subsubsection{Cycle Characteristic}
One of the basic but interesting characteristics is its cyclic nature. 
When we twist and turn the cube in a repeating pattern, it goes through a cycle. Basically, the idea is that the Rubik's cube is executed through a certain
number of moves /operations from the original state back to the original state again, thus achieving a cycle. The cycle characteristic of moves operation can be
divided into two categories: \textbf{periodic} and \textbf{non-periodic} based on the circulation period [$C_p$] (\textit{The number of the times the Rubik's Cube is rotated.})
If the $C_p$ is constant- the cycle is \textbf{periodic} and if $C_p$ is variable, then the cycle is non-periodic. The sequence of operations of a \textbf{non-periodic} cycle is
based on both the sequence of periodic cyclic operations
and the \textbf{“constant process”} [\textit{Refers to
the fact that all pieces can return to their original state
after this sequence of operations.}] that causes the cube’s pattern to exhibit a non-periodic change.

\subsection{Naming a Cubie}
\label{Name}




The division of the cube positions is shown in the figures \ref{Image_cubiePositionName} and \ref{Cubie pos. folded out}. The individual cubie positions are named with the abbreviations that describe their position with \textit{up, down, right, left, front} and \textit{back}.

\label{Cubie pos. folded out}
\end{figure}

\end{minipage}\begin{minipage}[b][][b]{0.04\textwidth}$\ $ \end{minipage}

In Figure \ref{Image_cubiePositionName} the names of the cubie positions on the cube are shown. In Figure \ref{Cubie pos. folded out} the cube can be seen in unfolded form. 

Each cubie position is assigned a unique name to identify it. This assumes that the white side is at the top in the starting configuration and the red side is at the front. The cubie positions are described with 3 letters, which consist of the abbreviations \textit{u, d, r, l, f, b}. These abbreviations stand for \textit{up, down, right, left, front, back}. \\
For example, the cubie position at the top left front is called \textit{ulf} (for \textit{up}, \textit{left} and \textit{front}).
\begin{note}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each cubie also gets a unique name that corresponds to its position when scrambled. 
        \item Sometimes we've to care which face has to be listed first- these are \textbf{Oriented Cubies}. For those cubies $urf$, $fur$, $rfu$ are different.\\
\textbf{Corner cubies are labeled by listing the facelets in clockwise order looking from the corner to the middle of the cube.}
        
\item In other cases, we don't care which face is listed first, so, that is \textbf{Unoriented Cubies}. 

\end{itemize}
\end{note}
A detailed discussion that I've not talked here can be found in this really interesting text \cite{lutterworth}. 


\section{Configuration of the Cube}
\label{Chapter_ConfigurationOfCube}

To work with the cube, we must determine the position it is in.
So, for a \Ttwo  cube, configuration is made up of two parameters :
\begin{itemize}
\item Position of the corner cubies (specified as $\sigma$)
\item Orientation of corner cubies (specified as $x$)
\end{itemize}
The configuration of the cube can be written as a 2-tuple: $(\sigma, x)$.
The position of the corner cubies is defined as a set of bijective functions $\sigma$ and the orientation of the corner cubies is defined as a vector $x$.

The idea and conceptualization of the \Tthree cube configuration is nicely discussed in \cite{JC,lutterworth}. Here, I've tried working the same for the \Ttwo cube. In contrast to the \Tthree cube, the \Ttwo cube only requires two instead of four configuration parameters. This means that the position and orientation of the edge cubies are not taken into account.

I've tried explaining the change of cube configuration step by step using an example move.

\subsection{Positions of the Cubies in the Cube}

\label{Section_PositionsOfThecubiesInTheCube}

The set of bijective functions $\sigma$ (for each rotation of the face) contains functions that represent the transitions of the cube pieces. The transitions describe the change in the position of the cubies during a move. The function $\sigma$ maps each cube position to a new position, this is a permutation mapping.


Now, to illustrate, the permutation $\sigma_U$ is defined for a rotation of the upper layer by 90$^\circ$ clockwise. 
Here, $\sigma_U$ is described in details and different notations are given. The derivation of the further rotations works analogously.
The rotation of the upper layer is shown graphically in the figures \ref{Figure_CubiePositionNameAfterU-1} and \ref{Figure_CubiePositionNameAfterU-2}.


\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{minipage}[b][][b]{0.04\textwidth}$\ $
\end{minipage}\begin{minipage}[b][][b]{0.43\textwidth}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{caged_spin.png}\\
\caption{Cubie positions in the cube after move $U$}
\label{Figure_CubiePositionNameAfterU-1}
\end{figure}

\end{minipage}\begin{minipage}[b][][b]{0.06\textwidth}$\ $ \end{minipage}\begin{minipage}[b][][b]{0.43\textwidth}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{foldedout_spin.png}
\caption{Folded out cube with cubie positions after move $U$}
\label{Figure_CubiePositionNameAfterU-2}
\end{figure}

\end{minipage}\begin{minipage}[b][][b]{0.04\textwidth}$\ $ \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{Figure_CubiePositionNameAfterU-1}, we can see that the cubies of the lower layer have not been moved. The upper layer positions have shifted one cubie clockwise. This results in the following function $\sigma_U$:
\begin{alignat*}{4}
& \sigma_U(\textit{ulf})=\textit{ulb} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \sigma_U(\textit{ulb})=\textit{urb} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \sigma_U(\textit{urb})=\textit{urf} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \sigma_U(\textit{urf})=\textit{ulf} \\
& \sigma_U(\textit{dlf})=\textit{dlf} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \sigma_U(\textit{dlb})=\textit{dlb} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \sigma_U(\textit{drb})=\textit{drb} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \sigma_U(\textit{drf})=\textit{drf} 
\end{alignat*}
The notation of the form $i \mapsto j$ is also common:
\begin{alignat*}{4}
& \textit{ulf} \mapsto \textit{ulb} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \textit{ulb} \mapsto \textit{urb} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \textit{urb} \mapsto \textit{urf} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \textit{urf} \mapsto \textit{ulf} \\
& \textit{dlf} \mapsto \textit{dlf} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \textit{dlb} \mapsto \textit{dlb} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \textit{drb} \mapsto \textit{drb} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ && \textit{drf} \mapsto \textit{drf} 
\end{alignat*}

This results in the following cycles: $\sigma_U = \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{ulb} \ \textit{urb} \ \textit{urf} )\ ( \textit{dlf} )\ ( \textit{dlb} )\ ( \textit{drb} )\ ( \textit{drf} )$

Single-element cycles do not need to be written down. Then, the cycle $\sigma_U = \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{ulb} \ \textit{urb} \ \textit{urf} )$. This cycle describes the transition of cubie positions as the upper layer is rotated.


The rotations of all layers can be described by the following cycles:
\begin{align*}
\sigma_U & =\ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{ulb} \ \textit{urb} \ \textit{urf} ) \\
\sigma_D & =\ ( \textit{dlf} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{dlb} ) \\
\sigma_F & =\ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{urf} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{dlf} ) \\
\sigma_B & =\ ( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{dlb} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{urb} ) \\
\sigma_L & =\ ( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{ulf} \ \textit{dlf} \ \textit{dlb} ) \\
\sigma_R & =\ ( \textit{urb} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{urf} ) 
\end{align*}

The indices on the functions $\sigma$ represent the various basic moves of the cube. 

The identity permutation is written as $\sigma=1$. This corresponds to the permutation of the empty move, which can be formed from other basic moves. I've explained it in section \ref{Section_EqualityOfmoves}.
Thus, the permutation of the empty move is defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
\sigma_N = 1
\end{align*}

\subsection{Orientation of the Cubies}
 \label{Section_AlignmentOfcubies}
The \Ttwo cube consists of eight corner cubies, each with three coloured areas. This means that each cubie has three possible orientations.
To recognize the alignment of the cubies, the cube positions on a coloured area are assigned a number. To do this, the white and yellow coloured cubies are marked and numbered. These numbers are referred to as $x_i$ with $i \in \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \rbrace$. $x_1$ corresponds to position 1, $x_2$ corresponds to position 2, etc. This is shown on the left in Figure \ref{MarkingX}.

In addition, each cubie is assigned a number on each coloured area. Since, each cubie can have three orientations, the coloured areas are numbered 0, 1 and 2. The numbering starts with the white or yellow area at 0 and then counts the areas clockwise. This is shown on the right in Figure \ref{MarkingX}.
In the starting configuration all $x_i = 0$, the vector $x$ is then $(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$. This is written as $x=0$ for short.

\caption[Markings $x_i$ (left), colour area numbers (right)]{Unfolded cube with markings for $x_i$ (left) and coloured area numbers (right)}
\label{MarkingX}
\end{figure}


The following is an example of the move $R$ and the change in the colour area numbering is shown for illustration (Figure \ref{Figure_XaftermoveR}). $R$ is a rotation of the right face by 90$^\circ$ clockwise.
The labels $x_{1-8}$ remain in the same position. The numbering of the coloured areas changes as the face rotates, allowing the corner cubie alignment to be assigned.
The left side of the cube is not affected. Therefore, the faces at positions $x_1, x_3, x_5, x_7$ are all 0 because they are assigned to the left half of the cube.
The other positions of $x$ now show different colour areas:
\begin{align*}
x_2 = 2 \ \ \ \ \ \ x_4 = 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ x_6 = 1 \ \ \ \ \ x_8 = 2
\end{align*}
Therefore, $x = (0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2)$ after move $R$ is made. This can also be seen from Figure \ref{Figure_XaftermoveR}. On the left are the positions of the vector entries of $x$ and on the right, we can see the cube with the coloured area numbering after the move $R$ has been made.

\end{figure}

Using the example move $R$, a function $\Gamma_R$ can be set up for each vector entry, which describes the change in the vector $x$ after executing the move $R$ for any initial configuration. Since $x_1, x_3, x_5$ and $x_7$ are not affected, they remain unchanged. The vector entry that is changed into the subsequent value by $\Gamma_R$ is highlighted in black below. All other entries are grayed out.
\begin{align*}
& \Gamma_{R_1}(\textcolor{gray}{(\textcolor{black}{x_1}, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )})=\textcolor{gray}{(\textcolor{black}{x_1}, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )} \\
& \Gamma_{R_3}(\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, \textcolor{black}{x_3}, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )})=\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, \textcolor{black}{x_3}, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )} \\
& \Gamma_{R_5}(\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, \textcolor{black}{x_5}, x_6, x_7, x_8  )})=\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, \textcolor{black}{x_5}, x_6, x_7, x_8  )}\\
& \Gamma_{R_7}(\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6,\textcolor{black}{x_7}, x_8  )})=\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, \textcolor{black}{x_7}, x_8  )} 
\end{align*}
The surfaces at positions $x_2, x_4, x_6$ and $x_8$ are changed depending on the previous cubie orientations. The following function results for the positions $x_2$ after the move $R$:


\begin{align*}
\Gamma_{R_2}(\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, \textcolor{black}{x_2}, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )})= \begin{cases}
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, \textcolor{black}{2}, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_4 = 0 \\ 
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, \textcolor{black}{0}, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_4 = 1 \\
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, \textcolor{black}{1}, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_4 = 2 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
The function $\Gamma_{R_2}$ changes the vector entry $x_2$ after executing the move $R$ depending on the vector entry $x_4$. The coloured area that reaches position $x_2$ by executing the move is directly dependent on the coloured area at position $x_4$, since it is the same cubie. If there is initially a colour area with value 0 at position $x_4$, executing $R$ will bring the color area with value 2 of the same cubie to position $x_2$. This can also be seen in Figure \ref{Figure_Transition functionR}. This works analogously with $x_4 = 1$ (then $x_2 = 0$) and $x_4=2$ (then $x_2 = 1$).

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.13]{TransitionfunctionR.png}
\caption{Change of $x_2$ with move $R$}
\label{Figure_Transition functionR}
\end{figure}

The other functions for changing the vector $x$ are also defined by the dependence of the cubie surfaces on each other.
\begin{align*}
\Gamma_{R_4}(\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \textcolor{black}{x_4}, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )})= \begin{cases}
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \textcolor{black}{1}, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_8 = 0 \\ 
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \textcolor{black}{2}, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_8 = 1 \\
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \textcolor{black}{0}, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_8 = 2 
\end{cases} \\
\\
\Gamma_{R_6}(\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, \textcolor{black}{x_6}, x_7, x_8  )})= \begin{cases}
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, \textcolor{black}{1}, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_2 = 0 \\ 
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, \textcolor{black}{2}, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_2 = 1 \\
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, \textcolor{black}{0}, x_7, x_8  )} & \ \text{falls } x_2 = 2 
\end{cases} \\
\\
\Gamma_{R_8}(\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, \textcolor{black}{x_8})})= \begin{cases}
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, \textcolor{black}{2})} & \ \text{falls } x_6 = 0 \\ 
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, \textcolor{black}{0})} & \ \text{falls } x_6 = 1 \\
\textcolor{gray}{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, \textcolor{black}{1})} & \ \text{falls } x_6 = 2 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
There are eight functions $\Gamma_R$ for the move $R$ -- one for each vector entry. The functions $\Gamma_{R_2}$ and $\Gamma_{R_8}$ change different vector entries in the same way, and so do the functions $\Gamma_{R_4}$ and $\Gamma_{R_6}$. The functions $\Gamma_{R_1}, \Gamma_{R_3}, \Gamma_{R_5}$ and $\Gamma_{R_7}$ also work analogously. Since, these functions have the same structure in terms of input and output, three different functions are sufficient for changing each vector entry after the move $R$.

$g(x)= \begin{cases}
2 & \ \text{falls } x = 0 \\

\end{cases}$
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}

$i(x) = x$

\vspace*{1em}

The functions $g$ and $h$ can also be written with modulo 3 without case distinction:
\begin{align*}
g(x)=(x+2) \hspace*{-0.5em} \mod 3 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ h(x) = (x+1) \hspace*{-0.5em} \mod 3
\end{align*}
Since \textit{i} is the identity function, it can be omitted.
The functions \textit{g} and \textit{h} can be used to determine the orientation of the cubies after the move $R$.  So,  the vector $x$ is changed after the move $R$ by the function $\gamma_R$, which is composed of the functions $\Gamma_{R_{1-8}}$:
\begin{align*}
& \gamma_R \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  ) \right) =  \left( x_1, g(x_4), x_3, h(x_8), x_5, h(x_2), x_7, g(x_6) \right)
\end{align*}
Similarly, for each of the six basic moves there is a function $\gamma$ that changes the cubie orientation. These functions can also be formed with the functions $g$, $h$ and $i$.
\begin{align*}
& \gamma_U \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  ) \right) =  \left( x_3, x_1, x_4, x_2, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8 \right) \\
\\ 
& \gamma_D \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  ) \right)  =  \left( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_6, x_8, x_5, x_7 \right) \\
\\
& \gamma_R \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  ) \right)  =  \left( x_1, g(x_4), x_3, h(x_8), x_5, h(x_2), x_7, g(x_6) \right) \\ 
\\
& \gamma_L \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  ) \right)  =   (h(x_5), x_2, g(x_1), x_4, g(x_7), x_6, h(x_3), x_8) \\ 
\\
& \gamma_F \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  ) \right)  =  \left( x_1, x_2, h(x_7), g(x_3), x_5, x_6, g(x_8), h(x_4) \right) \\
\\
& \gamma_B \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  ) \right)  =  \left( g(x_2), h(x_6), x_3, x_4, h(x_1), g(x_5), x_7, x_8 \right)
\end{align*}
For the empty move,  the vector remains unchanged. The function $\gamma_N$ of the empty move can be formed from the other functions. The following function results:
\begin{align*}
& \gamma_N \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8  ) \right) =  \left( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8 \right)
\end{align*}
The above example of the move $R$ (figure \ref{Figure_XaftermoveR}) is now calculated step by step using $\gamma_R$. To do this, the cube is initially in the starting configuration ($x = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$). The cubie position is not taken into account here. When the move $R$ is made, $\gamma_R( (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) )$ is calculated:
\begin{align*}
& \gamma_R( (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) ) \\
& = (0, g(0), 0, h(0), 0, h(0), 0, g(0)) \\
& = (0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2)
\end{align*}
The vector $x$ after the move $R$ starting from the starting configuration is therefore $(0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2)$.

\subsection{Execute Moves}
\label{Section_MovementExecute}
A cube configuration $C=(\sigma, x)$ is changed by making a move.
The permutation $\sigma$, then, represents the new position of the cubies in the cube and the vector $x$ represents the orientation of the cubies. A move $Z$ can be one of the basic moves ($U,D,R,L,F,B$) or any sequence of basic moves. \\
If a move $Z$ is made on a cube configuration $C$, it is written as $C \cdot Z$. The result of $C \cdot Z$ is then a new configuration $C'$.

\begin{example}
Let the move $LLFF$ is applied three times to the starting configuration $C=(1,0)$. 
And so, the position of the cubies (represented by $\sigma$ ) changes as follows after the first execution of $LLFF$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Move} & \textbf{ulb} & \textbf{urb} & \textbf{ulf} & \textbf{urf} & \textbf{dlb} & \textbf{drb} & \textbf{dlf} & \textbf{drf} \\
\midrule

L & ulf & \textcolor{gray}{urb} & dlf & \textcolor{gray}{urf} & ulb & \textcolor{gray}{drb} & dlb & \textcolor{gray}{drf} \\

L & dlf & \textcolor{gray}{urb} & dlb & \textcolor{gray}{urf} & ulf & \textcolor{gray}{drb} & ulb & \textcolor{gray}{drf} \\

F & ulf & \textcolor{gray}{urb} & \textcolor{gray}{dlb} & drf & urf & \textcolor{gray}{drb} & \textcolor{gray}{ulb} & dlf \\

F & urf & \textcolor{gray}{urb} & \textcolor{gray}{dlb} & dlf & drf & \textcolor{gray}{drb} & \textcolor{gray}{ulb} & ulf \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The vector $x$ is calculated after the partial move $LLFF$ by $\gamma_F(\gamma_F(\gamma_L(\gamma_L(x))))$.  
\begin{align*}
 \gamma_F(\gamma_F(\gamma_L(\gamma_L(x)))) \Rightarrow \ & \gamma_F(\gamma_F(\gamma_L(\gamma_L((0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))))) \\
= \ & \gamma_F(\gamma_F(\gamma_L((h(0),0,g(0),0,g(0),0,h(0),0)))) \\
= \ & \gamma_F(\gamma_F(\gamma_L((1,0,2,0,2,0,1,0)))) \\
= \ & \gamma_F(\gamma_F((h(1),0,g(2),0,g(2),0,h(1),0))) \\
= \ & \gamma_F(\gamma_F((0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))) \\
= \ & \gamma_F((0,0,h(0),g(0),0,0,g(0),h(0))) \\
= \ & \gamma_F((0,0,1,2,0,0,2,1)) \\
= \ & (0,0,h(1),g(2),0,0,g(2),h(1)) \\
= \ & (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
\end{align*}
From this calculation, we see that after performing the rotation $L$ the vector becomes $(1,0,2,0,2,0,1,0)$. If $L$ movement is executed again, the vector is again $(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$. However, the cube is not solved yet because the position of the cubies ($\sigma$) is changed.
If the rotation $F$ is carried out twice, the vector via $(0,0,1,2,0,0,2,1)$ changes back to $(0,0,0,0,0,0, 0,0)$.

The configuration $C'$ after the first execution of the  move $LLFF$ is therefore
\begin{align*}
C' = ((\textit{ulb} \ \textit{urf} \ \textit{dlf} )\ ( \textit{dlb} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{ulf} ),(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))
\end{align*} 
or  $C' = ((\textit{ulb} \ \textit{urf} \ \textit{dlf} ) \ (\textit{dlb} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{ulf} ),0)$ . If the move $LLFF$ is executed again, the vector $x$ changes again in the same way and thus becomes $(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$ again. The permutation $\sigma$ of the position gives, after executing $LLFF$ for the second time: $(\textit{urf} \ \textit{dlf} \ \textit{ulb}) \ ( \textit{drf} \ \textit{ulf } \ \textit{dlb} )$. The resulting configuration after executing $LLFF$ for the second time is therefore:
\begin{align*}
C'' = (( \textit{dlf} \ \textit{urf} \ \textit{ulb} \ ) \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{dlb} ),(0,0 ,0,0,0,0,0,0))
\end{align*}

Executing $LLFF$ for the third time returns the cube to its initial configuration. The permutation function is therefore $1$ (the identity) and the vector $x$ is again $(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$. The configuration is then:
\begin{align*}
C''' = (1,0).
\end{align*}
It follows that the move $LLFF$ returns the cube to its original state after executing three times.
\end{example}

\section{Subgroups of G$_{2\times 2\times 2}$}


\label{Chapters_Subgroups}

Here, we'll talk about some of the subgroups of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$. In the first part, we'll talk about the trivial subgroups.

In addition,  we delve into understanding the structure of two subgroups using  Cayley graphs. The subgroup that minimally but completely represents the \Ttwo cube can be found in chapter \ref{Chapter_MinSubgroup}.

\subsection{Example Subgroups}
\label{Section_SubgroupExamples}

Each group has two trivial subgroups: the group with the identity element and the group itself.  The two trivial subgroups of $(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle *)$ are here called $(H_N, \scriptstyle *)$ and $(H_G, \scriptstyle *)$:
\begin{align*}
(H_N, \scriptstyle*) &\subseteq (\mathcal{G}_{2 \times 2 \times 2}, \scriptstyle *) \text{ and } \\
(H_G, \scriptstyle*) &\subseteq (\mathcal{G}_{2 \times 2 \times 2}, \scriptstyle *)
\end{align*}
The subgroup $\left(H_N, \scriptstyle*\right)$
 only contains the equivalence class of the identity element $N$ in the set $H_N$. However, for the subgroup $\left(H_G, \scriptstyle*\right)$
, the  set $H_G$ is the same set as $\Gtwo$.
\begin{align*}
(H_N, \scriptstyle*) &= (\{N\}, \scriptstyle*)  \\
(H_G, \scriptstyle*) &= (\mathcal{G}_{2 \times 2 \times 2}, \scriptstyle*)
\end{align*}

In this work, I've discussed only a part of the subgroups of $(\Gtwo, scriptstyle*)$.
The following section describes two illustrative subgroups of the cube. Tom Davis discussed these subgroups for the \Tthree cube in \cite{TD}. And I'll try to do the same for the the \Ttwo cube:
\begin{itemize}
\item The subgroup $\left(H_{E1}, \scriptstyle*\right)$ only allows the rotation of one face. The moves of the set only reach four cube configurations (both for the \Ttwo and the \Tthree cube). This can also be easily understood with a \textit{Cube}, as only four different results can be achieved by rotating just one layer.

Since the generating set $H_{E1}$ contains the equivalence classes of all possible moves of the subgroup, exactly four elements are contained here. Each move made by rotating a face is a representative of these four moves.

Using the mathematical model of the \Ttwo cube, it can also be determined that the moves of the subgroup $(H_{E1}, \scriptstyle*)$ achieve exactly four cube configurations.

Each face rotation ($U, D, R, L, F$ or $B$) is defined by a permutation function $\sigma$. For each of these basic features, $\sigma$ consists of only one four-element cycle ( section \ref{Section_PositionsOfThecubiesInTheCube}). \textbf{The order of the permutation is always 4 in the case of a single face rotation} (Section \ref{Section_OrderPermutations}).

When ordering a move, in addition to the permutations, the function $\gamma$, which represents the orientation of the cubies, is taken into account. \textbf{Each of these functions $\gamma$ returns the input unchanged when executed four times in succession.} The proof of this can be found in appendix \ref{Appendix_AlignmentFunctions}.

So, the takeaway point is  \textbf{the order of a single face rotation is always four and the generated set $H_{E1}$ contains exactly four moves. With these four moves, exactly four different cube configurations can be achieved.}



\item Another subgroup of $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ is $(H_{E2}, \scriptstyle*)$. Here two opposite faces can be rotated.
For the group of \Tthree cubes, this results in 16 possible cube configurations \cite{TD}. However, in the case of the \Ttwo \textit{Cube} there are only four, as there are only two levels and the rotation of the cube cannot be distinguished using the center cubies. The equivalence classes of the rotations result in a subgroup equivalent to $\left(H_{E1}, \scriptstyle*\right)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generator}
\label{section_GeneratorGF}

The following examples come from \cite{TD} and again they're applied from the group of the \Tthree \textit{Cube} to the \Ttwo \textit{Cube}. 

An example of a generator of a subgroup $\left(G_F, \scriptstyle*\right)$ of $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ is the single move $\{ F \}$ that creates this subgroup. Exactly four cube configurations can be achieved by the move $F$ and the generating set $G_F$ of the subgroup $\left(G_F, \scriptstyle*\right)$ therefore contains four elements:
\begin{align*}
G_F = \{N, F, FF, FFF\}
\end{align*}
All additional moves generated by $F$ are equivalent to one of these moves. For example, $FFFF$ is a representative of the equivalence class of $N$ -- the cube is back in the starting position after making this move.


Another example is the subgroup created by $\{FF\}$. The upper layer can only make half turns (instead of quarter turns \cite{TR}) and can therefore only reach two positions. The generating set therefore contains the equivalence classes of the two moves $FF$ and $N$.

The complete group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle* \right)$ is generated by $\{U, D, R, L, F, B\}$. A minimal group of the \Ttwo cube is described in section \ref{Chapter_MinSubgroup} and is generated by $\{U, R, F\}$.

The subgroup $\left(G_F, \scriptstyle*\right)$ generated by $F$ described above is one such cyclic subgroup.
$\left(G_F, \scriptstyle*\right)$ is generated by:
\begin{align*}
\langle F \rangle = \{ F^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
\end{align*}
This means that the  set $G_F$ contains the equivalence classes of the following elements:
\begin{align*}
\{..., F^{-2}, F^{-1}, F^0, F^1, F^2, ...\}
\end{align*}
Cyclic groups can be infinite. However, the group $(G_F, \circ)$ is finite. 
This follows from a theorem in Group theory. 
\begin{theorem}
A group of finite order has a finite cyclic subgroup. 
\end{theorem}
The proof for the theorem has been discussed and done in \ref{Cycle Proof}. 

Since the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ is finite, each element of the group produces a finite cyclic subgroup. The size of this subgroup depends on the order of the moves. 
For example, the order of the move $FR$ is 15. If $FR$ is executed 15 times on the \Ttwo cube, it is back in the starting position.
The group created by $\{FR\}$, therefore, has 15 elements, since 15 cube configurations can be reached with the move. For the \Tthree cube, the order of the move is $FR$: $105$ \cite{TD}.

\subsection{Subgroup Generated by \textit{FF} and \textit{RR}}
\label{section_subgroupFFRR}

The example of the subgroup created by $\{ FF, RR \}$ in \Tthree cube is described by Tom Davis in \cite{TD} and here it is done for the \Ttwo cube .
Since the two moves $FF$ and $RR$ are seen as single unit, each of these rotations must be a half rotation.
It has already been shown in Section \ref{Section_EqualityOfmoves} that $(FF)^2$ and $(RR)^2$ are representatives of the equivalence class of $I$, because after making these moves the cube is back in its original configuration. So it applies to any configuration $C$:
\begin{align*}
C \cdot (FF)^2 = C \textit{ and } C \cdot (RR)^2 = C
\end{align*}

If $FFRR$ is executed on a solved \Ttwo cube, the cube will be back in the starting configuration after three repetitions. This also applies to the move $RRFF$. The order of $FFRR$ and $RRFF$ is therefore 3. For the \Tthree \textit{Cube}, the order of these moves is 6 \cite{TD}.
The subgroup of the \Tthree cube created by $\{ FF, RR \}$ therefore has more elements than that of the \Ttwo cube.

All members of the subgroup of the \Ttwo \textit{Cube} are listed below. All other possible combinations of $FF$ and $RR$ achieve the same cube configuration as these seven moves:
\begin{center}
\label{7move}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
$I$ & $RR$ & $FFRR$ & $RRFFRR$ \\
& $FF$ & $RRFF$ & $FFRRFF$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{note}
For comparison: Tom Davis gets twelve elements in the subgroup created by $\{ FF, RR \}$ for the \Tthree cube.
\end{note}

The equivalent moves can also be recognized mathematically without trying out the moves on cube.
\begin{example}
Let the move be $(RRFF)^2 RR$. 
\begin{align*}
(RRFF)^2 RR = RRFFRRFFRR
\end{align*}
Since $RRFF$ is of order 3, after executing $(RRFF)^3$ on any cube configuration $C$, the cube is back to the initial configuration.
\begin{align*}
C \cdot (RRFF)^3 = C \cdot RRFFRRFFRRFF = C
\end{align*}
It can be concluded that after executing $RRFFRRFFRR$, only $FF$ needs to be executed to get back to the starting position. Thus, the position reached by $RRFFRRFFRR$ can also be reached by $(FF)^{-1}$.
\begin{align*}
C \cdot RRFFRRFFRR = C \cdot (FF)^{-1}
\end{align*}
Since the inverse of a move $Z$ is defined as $ZZZ$, the following applies to the moves $FF$ and $RR$:
\begin{align*}
(FF)^{-1} = F^{-1}F^{-1} = FFFFFF = FF \\
(RR)^{-1} = R^{-1}R^{-1} = RRRRRR = RR
\end{align*}
The inverses of the moves $FF$ and $RR$ are, therefore, $FF$ and $RR$. Therefore, the move $RRFFRRFFRR$ is equivalent to the move $FF$, since the latter is equivalent to $(FF)^{-1}$. This therefore applies to any cube configuration $C$:
\begin{align*}
C \cdot RRFFRRFFRR = C \cdot FF
\end{align*}
\end{example}

The fact that $\{ FF, RR \}$ produces a subgroup with seven and twelve elements in the \Ttwo cubes \ and \Tthree cubes, respectively, is worth noting, since $\{ F, R \}$ in the \Tthree cubes produce a subgroup of size $73\, 483\, 200$ \cite{TD}.
For the \Ttwo \textit{Cube} the subgroup comes with $5! \cdot 3^5$ to just $29 \, 160$ members.

\subsection{Cayley Graph}

I've discussed Cayley graphs in appendix \ref{cayley}. They are used to visualize cyclic groups and their generators.
A simple example can be seen in Figure \ref{Figure_CayleygraphF}. The Cayley graph of the subgroup $\left(G_F, \scriptstyle*\right)$ of $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$, which is generated by $\{ F \}$. The subgroup $\left(G_F, \scriptstyle*\right)$ was described in chapter \ref{section_GeneratorGF}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Cayleygraph1.png}
\caption{Cayley graph generated by generator $\{ F \}$}
\label{Figure_CayleygraphF}
\end{figure}

This Cayley graph is simple. 
The subgroup is generated by the face rotation $F$. This results in four elements in the generating set:
\begin{align*}
G_F = \{F, FF, FFF, N\}
\end{align*}
Each element of $G_F$ is represented by a node. The arrows between the nodes show which element results from further performing with a generator. In this case, the cycle of a single face rotation can be seen.


In comparison, the Cayley graph of the subgroup generated by $\{ FF, RR \}$ is more complex (Figure \ref{Figure_CayleygraphFFRR}). This subgroup was described in section \ref{section_subgroupFFRR}.
The red arrows represent the generator $\{FF\}$, as this is the red side of the cube in the starting configuration. The blue arrows represent the generator $\{RR\}$, as this is the blue side of the cube.
Elements that are generated by another element in combination with a generator are connected to each other by an arrow (that represents a generator).

For example, using this Cayley graph it can be seen that the moves $FFFF$ and $RRRR$ correspond to the identity element $N$. A red arrow leads from node $FF$ to $N$. The red arrows represent the generator $FF$. Thus, $FFFF$ and $N$ produce the same cube configuration.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{Cayleygraph2.png}
\caption{Cayley graph generated by generator $\{ FF, RR \}$}
\label{Figure_CayleygraphFFRR}
\end{figure}

The Cayley graph of the generators $FF$ and $RR$ is more complex than the graph of the subgroup $\left(G_F, \scriptstyle*\right)$ (Figure \ref{Figure_CayleygraphF}). Nevertheless, compared to the size of the other generating subgroups of $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$, it represents a very small generated subgroup. The subgroups and Cayley graphs can be used for the group of the \Ttwo cube (and the \Tthree cube) becomes very big. In chapter \ref{Chapter_MinSubgroup} the subgroup of the minimum, complete image of the cube is defined. The Cayley graph of this subgroup is described in section \ref{section_CayleygraphMIN} and contains $3, 647,160$ nodes.

\section{Valid Configurations of the Cube}

\label{Chapter_ValidConfigurations}

I'll now try to calculate the number of valid cube configurations using two different approaches. While in section \ref{Section_NumberConfigurations} the number is calculated using the physical cube, in section \ref{Section_CardinalityOfG} the number is calculated using the group $\left(\Gtwo,\scriptstyle*\right)$. For this purpose, the cardinality of the group is determined. It also explains why the number of elements in $\Gtwo$ corresponds to the number of valid cube configurations.

I've also shown that \textbf{for the orientation $x$ of the cubies $( \sum_{i= 1}^{8} \ x_i ) \mod 3 = 0$ applies.}

\subsection{Number of Valid Cube Configurations}
\label{Section_NumberConfigurations}

We'll now calculate calculates the number of possible cube configurations based on the cube. Not all of the theoretically possible cube configurations can actually be achieved by rotating the faces. We'll calculate step by step based on the structure of the cube which are the possibilities that we can achieve in the case of  \Ttwo cube. 

To do this, the number of possible cubie positions is first calculated:
The corner-cubies can be located in any of the eight corners. That's why there are 8 possible positions in the cube for each corner cubie. Since there are eight corner cubies, that's $8! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 = 40,320$ possible positions for the corner cubies.

In addition, the corner cubies can be rotated, so there can be different coloured areas at the top. Since the cubies consist of three colored areas, seven of them can take on three different orientations by rotating the face. The eighth cubie can be assumed to be correctly rotated due to the possibility of rotating the entire cube. There are therefore $3^7 = 2,187$ possibilities for the orientation of the corner cubies.

Since there are no center cubies in the cube, rotating the cube reduces the possibilities by a factor of 24 because there are six sides, each of which can have four orientations. This leads to $6 \cdot 4 = 24$.
All $24$ alignment options are shown in appendix \ref{Appendix_RotationsOfCube}.

This results in $(3^7 \cdot 8!) \cdot \frac{1}{24} = 3, 674, 160$ possible configurations for the cube.

\begin{note}
The number of cube configurations without taking into account the rotations of the cube is $8! \cdot 3^8 = 264, 539 , 520$ \cite{MMFAA}. Taking rotations into account, the number is $3, 674, 160$ possibilities.
\end{note}

\subsection{Cardinality of \textit{G}$_{2 \times 2 \times 2}$} 

\label{Section_CardinalityOfG}

The cardinality of the group $(G_{2\times 2\times 2},\scriptstyle*)$ is the number of elements in $G_{2\times 2\times 2}$ and is denoted by $|G_{2\times 2\times 2}|$. The cardinality of the group corresponds to the number of valid cube configurations since $G_{2\times 2\times 2}$ contains the equivalence classes of all possible moves. If two moves with the same initial configuration produce the same resulting configuration of the cube, they are representatives of the same equivalence class in $G_{2\times 2\times 2}$. Thus, each element of $G_{2\times 2\times 2}$ brings the cube into a different cube configuration, and no equivalent moves are included twice. In addition, the equivalence classes were formed with the set of all moves of the cube. So, every possible move is included and $|G_{2\times 2\times 2}|$ corresponds to the number of valid cube configurations.


Since the cardinality of the group $\left(\Gtwo,\scriptstyle*\right)$ corresponds to the number of valid cube configurations, it is composed of the product of the valid configuration parameters $\sigma$ and $x$. In addition, the equivalences regarding the rotations must be taken into account.

$\sigma$ is the set of bijective functions for each face rotation. The transitions of the eight cube pieces are included as permutations. Since there are eight permutation objects, the number of permutation possibilities is calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
8! = 40, 320
\end{align*}

The other parameter of the cube configuration is the 8-dimensional vector $x$. Each of the values in $x$ is from the set $\{0,1,2\}$. Thus, there are three possibilities for each value in the vector. The number of possible configurations of the vector is calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
3^8 = 6,561
\end{align*}

Without taking rotations into account, a value of $40, 320 \cdot 6561 = 26,45,39,520$ possible configurations can be achieved.
Since one of the cubie orientations in $x$ can be assumed to be correct due to the rotations, $3^7$ is calculated instead of $3^8$ for eight possible orientations:
\begin{align*}
3^7 = 2, 187
\end{align*}
There are also $6 \cdot 4 = 24$ rotation possibilities that are taken into account in the equivalence classes. %All 24 rotation options are shown in appendix \ref{Appendix_RotationsDesWürfels}. 
Thus, the number of cube configurations must be divided by 24. The following calculation results in calculating the number of valid cube configurations:
\begin{align*}
& 8! \cdot 3^7 / 24 \\
= \ & 40 , 320 \cdot 2 , 187 / 24 \\
= \ & 8,8  1,79 , 840 / 24 \\
= \ & 3 6,74, 160
\end{align*}

\textbf{$|\Gtwo|$ is therefore $36,74, 160$.
This corresponds to the number of valid cube configurations.}


\subsection{Orientation of the Cubies (modulo 3)}

\label{Section_Modulo3}

In \cite{JC}, the author discussed about the alignment vectors of the corners and edges of the \Tthree cube. Since, the \Ttwo cube, in contrast to the \Tthree cube, has no corner cubies, only the statement about the vector of the corner cubies will be in use here. In addition, the \Ttwo cube does not have a clear top side and therefore the following statement does not apply exclusively to the top and bottom of the cube, but to all opposite sides.


The configuration of the cube is defined as $C=(\sigma, x)$. This section shows that for any valid cube configuration the following applies to the values of the vector $x$:
\begin{displaymath}
\boxed{\left( \sum_{i= 1}^{8} \ x_i \right) \hspace*{-0.7em} \mod 3 = 0}
\end{displaymath}

Let, $C'=(\sigma', x')$ be a resulting configuration of an arbitrary configuration $C=(\sigma, x)$. Here, $Z$ is one of the moves from $\Gtwo$.
\begin{align*}
{(\sigma, x) \cdot Z = (\sigma', x')}
\end{align*}
The following then applies to the vectors $x$ and $x'$:
\begin{align*}
\left( \sum_{i= 1}^{8} \ x_i \right) \hspace*{-0.5em} \mod 3 = \left( \sum_{i= 1}^{8} \ x_i' \right ) \hspace*{-0.5em} \mod 3 = 0
\end{align*}
The change in vector entries due to the basic moves of the cube, starting from the starting configuration, can also be seen in this table:
\vspace*{1em}

\begin{adjustbox}{width=1\textwidth,center}

\begin{tabular}{cllcc}

\textit{L} & $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8)$ & $(1, x_2, 2, x_4, 2, x_6, 1, x_8)$ & 6 & 0 \\
\textit{F} & $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8)$ & $(x_1, x_2, 1, 2, x_5, x_6, 2, 1)$ & 6 & 0 \\
\textit{B} & $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8)$ & $(2, 1, x_3, x_4, 1, 2, x_7, x_8)$ & 6 & 0 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{adjustbox}

\vspace{1cm}
This applies to both the starting configuration and the resulting configuration after executing a basic move
\begin{align*}
(\sum_{i= 1}^{8} \ x_i) \mod 3 = 0
\end{align*}


The cube can be changed by one of the basic moves of the cube or a combination of the basic moves. The changes to the vector $x$ by executing the basic moves can be seen in detail in the following table. The variable $s$ describes the change in the sum of the vector entries. In section \ref{Section_AlignmentOfcubies} the functions are defined that implement the changes in the vector $x$ for each of the moves.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{adjustbox}
\ \\


Any valid cube configuration $C$ can only be reached by moves. Moves consist of elements of the set $\{U, D, R, L, F, B\}$. In the starting configuration, the sum of the vector entries is $0$. The vector $x$ is $(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$ and the sum of the entries is therefore 0. The following applies:
\begin{align*}
\left( \sum_{i= 1}^{8} \ (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) \right) \hspace*{-0.5em} \mod 3 = 0
\end{align*}
For each of the basic moves from $\{U, D, R, L, F, B\}$, the sum of the vector entries is changed by the value of $s$. The basic features of the variable $s$ are either 0 or 6. This therefore applies to every possible $s$:
\begin{align*}
s \hspace*{-0.5em} \mod 3 = 0
\end{align*}
Thus, the sum $s$ of the vector entries must always be 0 when calculating modulo 3, since each move $Z$ consists of one of the basic moves from $\{U, D, R, L, F, B\}$ or a combination this exists. Any multiple of 6 and 0 results in 0 when calculated modulo 3. It therefore also applies:
\begin{align*}
(k \cdot s) \hspace*{-0.5em} \mod 3 = 0 \textit{ for } k \in \mathbb{N}
\end{align*}
And therefore for every $x$ from any configuration $(\sigma, x)$ also holds:
\begin{align*}
\left( \sum_{i= 1}^{8} \ x_i \right) \hspace*{-0.5em} \mod 3 = 0.
\end{align*}

Since, it was shown in section \ref{Section_RotationOfCube} that the rotations can also be defined as a combination of moves, the statement also applies to every rotation of the cube.
For every valid cube position, ${(\sum_{i = 1}^{8} \ x_i') \mod 3 = (\sum_{i = 1}^{8} \ x_i) \mod 3 }$, therefore, applies.
If there is a valid configuration $C'=(\sigma', x')$ for which $\sum_{i = 1}^{8} x_i' \mod 3 = 0$, then there is a move $Z \in \Gtwo$ so that $Z \cdot C'$ brings the cubies into the configuration $(1,x)$ All cubies are then in the correct position, but are not correctly aligned.
From this configuration $(1,x)$ there is a move $Z \in \Gtwo$ so that all corner pieces are correctly aligned. Then, the configuration is $(1, 0)$ and all corner pieces are in the correct orientation and position. The cube is, then, in the starting configuration.


\section{Solution of the Cube}

\label{Chapter_Solution}

The usual method of solving a Rubik's Cube is by combining different face rotations. These are applied as operations and they specifically change the configuration of the cube.
For example, there is a combination that swaps three of the four corners of the upper layer with each other in a clockwise direction and does not change their orientation.
In this section, I delved into examining the number of $2$ cycles of the moves of the cube [basically to obtain information about the position of the cubies due to the moves] and commutators.
Also, I've described the patterns of the cube algorithmically,  displayed them graphically, and finally tried using the solution algorithms of  \Tthree \textit{Cube} to the \Ttwo \textit{Cube} \cite{fridrich1997, ruwix_advanced_cfop_fridrich, tran_mathematical_approach_rubiks_cube}.

\subsection{Number of Transpositions ($2$-cycles)}

The position of the cubies is described by the permutation functions $\sigma$. $\sigma$ consists of different cycles depending on the position of the cubies. This was defined and described in section \ref{Section_PositionsOfThecubiesInTheCube}. 
Before moving further, I state an important note related to Permutation groups, The proof has been discussed in Appendix \ref{Cycle Proof}.  
\vspace{1cm}
\begin{note}
Each $n$ cycle can be written as a product of $2$ cycles. If $n$ is even, the corresponding $2$-cycle product has an odd number of $2$-cycles [odd permutation] and If $n$ is odd, the corresponding $2$-cycle product has an even number of $2$-cycles [even permutation].   
\end{note}


 
\vspace{1cm}
Each cube configuration can be defined by a combination of the rotations \textit{U}, \textit{D}, \textit{R}, \textit{L}, \textit{F}, \textit{B}. 
The cycles of the cube's individual 6 face rotations are written as a product of $2$ cycles:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\sigma_U &  = \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{ulb} \ \textit{urb} \ \textit{urf} ) &&  = \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{ulb} )   \ 
( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{urb} )  \ 
( \textit{ulf} \  \textit{urf} )\\

\sigma_D & = \ ( \textit{dlf} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{dlb} )  && = \ ( \textit{dlf} \ \textit{drf} )  \ 
( \textit{dlf} \ \textit{drb}  )  \ 
( \textit{dlf} \ \textit{dlb} )\\

\sigma_F & = \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{urf} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{dlf} )  && = \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{urf} ) \ 
( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{drf} ) \ 
( \textit{ulf}  \ \textit{dlf} ) \\

\sigma_B & = \ ( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{dlb} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{urb} )  && = \ ( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{dlb} ) \ 
( \textit{ulb} \  \textit{drb} ) \ 
( \textit{ulb}  \ \textit{urb} )\\

\sigma_L & = \ ( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{ulf} \ \textit{dlf} \ \textit{dlb} )  && = \ ( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{ulf} )  \ 
( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{dlf}  )  \ 
( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{dlb} ) \\

\sigma_R & = \ ( \textit{urb} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{urf} ) && = \  ( \textit{urb} \ \textit{drb}  )  \ 
( \textit{urb} \  \textit{drf} )  \ 
( \textit{urb} \ \textit{urf} )  \
\end{alignat*}

It can be seen that each basic move is defined by a $4$ cycle. And so, each $4$ cycle can be written as a product of three $2$ cycles [\textit{Odd permutation: and thus the number of $2$ cycles of a single face rotation is therefore odd.}] The number of $2$ cycles of a move consisting of two face rotations is, therefore, even.
For example, the move $LF$ has an even number of $2$ cycles:
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{LF} & = (\textit{ulb} \ \textit{urf} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{dlf} \ \textit{dlb}) =  (\textit{ulb} \ \textit{urf}) \ (\textit{ulb} \ \textit{drf}) \ (\textit{ulb} \ \textit{dlf}) \ (\textit{ulb} \ \textit{dlb})
\end{align*}
\begin{note}
The cycles only provide information about the position of the cubies in the cube. The rotation is represented by the vector $x$ and I've not taken it into account here.
\end{note}
For the \Tthree cube, the number of $2$ cycles of each permutation is even, so there is no move that swaps exactly two cubies in the cube \cite{TD}. A move that swaps exactly two cubies is represented by \textit{one} $2$ cycle - that means an odd number ($1$ is odd number) of $2$ cycles, so that's not possible in \Tthree \textit{cube}. In contrast to the \Tthree cube, the number of $2$ cycles of the \Ttwo cube is odd and therefore there are algorithms for this cube that swap the position of exactly two cubies. I've tried discussing those algorithms in section \ref{Section_AlgorithmsSecondlayer}.

\subsection{Commutators}
\label{section_commutators8}
 
\begin{definition}[Commutator]
If $g, h \in G$ where G is a group with binary operation $\scriptstyle *$, the element 
$$\boxed{[g,h] =ghg^{-1}h^{-1}}$$ is called as the commutator of $g,h$. 
\end{definition}
 \begin{note}
The commutator may be regarded as a rough measurement of the lack of commutativity. It says something about how strongly two elements of a group violate the commutative law. \cite{wong2010group}
\end{note}
\begin{definition}
    Group generated by the commutators is called the \textbf{commutator subgroup of G}. 

    $$\boxed{\{[g,h]| g, h \in G\}}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
    Commutator Subgroup may be regarded as a rough measurement of the lack of commutativity of group G.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
    In abelian groups, the commutator of two elements is the identity element of the group \cite{TD,hutchings2022mathematics}. 
\end{note}



\begin{example}

$[5,7]$ is a commutator of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$. $[5,7]$ corresponds to $5+7-5-7 = 0$ and $0$ is the identity element of the group.  $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is commutative, therefore the commutator of all elements of the group is $0$.

\end{example}

\vspace{1cm}

The commutator of two moves $Y, Z$ of the group $(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle *)$ is therefore defined as:
\begin{align*}
[Y,Z]=YZY^{-1}Z^{-1}
\end{align*}
Commuting elements are elements that act as commutators to form the identity element of a group. The identity here is the move $N$.
\begin{align*}
[Y,Z]= N\ \Rightarrow \textit{ $Y$ and $Z$ are commutating elements}
\end{align*}
\begin{proposition}
Two identical moves $Y, Z$ of the group $(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle *)$ commute. Then, the commutator $[Y, Z]$ is a representative of the equivalence class of the empty move $N$
$\forall \ Y, Z \in \Gtwo,$
$Y = Z \ . \ [Y, Z] = N$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proofcustom}
    

Since $Y=Z$, so 
$[Y,Z]$ is now written as $[Z,Z]$  $\forall \ Z \in \Gtwo\ . [Z, Z] = N$

So, applying this to any cube configuration $C$, the commutator of two equal elements is defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
\forall \ Z \in \Gtwo\ . \ C \cdot [Z, Z] = C
\end{align*}
This can then be transformed into as :
\begin{align*}
C \cdot [Z, Z] & = C \cdot ZZZ^{-1}Z^{-1} \\
& = C \cdot Z(ZZ^{-1})Z^{-1} \\
& = C \cdot Z(N)Z^{-1} \\
& = C \cdot ZZ^{-1} \\
& = C \cdot N \\
& = C
\end{align*}
Thus, all those pairs of move commute from $\Gtwo$, which consist of two identical moves.
\end{proofcustom}

We know \textbf{Disjoint cycles commute} [Appendix \ref{Cycle Proof}]. So, not only identical pairs of moves commute, but also the moves that affect opposite faces, because they don't move the same cubies. In the case of the vector $x$, no common entries are affected either.
These are, then, the following commutators, with $n, m \in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{align*}
[U^n, D^m] \ \ \ \  \ \ \ [F^n, B^m] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [L^n, R^m] \\
[D^n, U^m] \ \ \ \ \ \ \  [B^n, F^m] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [R^n, L^m] 
\end{align*}

Since, the pairs of moves do not affect the same cubies, it is not clear whether the group is commutative or not. By constructing the commutator, both moves are executed and inverted again.


If two moves $Y, Z \in \Gtwo$ do not commute, the understanding of the commutator can be used to some extent to predict how large the change in the cube configuration (the rough measurement of not being commutative) is after executing $[Y, Z]$ .

\begin{example}
Let's take the moves $L$ and $F$ and the starting configuration $C = (1,0)$:
\begin{align*}
C \cdot [L, F] = C \cdot LFL^{-1}F^{-1}
\end{align*}
Four of the eight cubies in the cube change their position and orientation. The other four remain unchanged.
The following permutations result from executing $[L, F]$.
\begin{center}

If the top row of the table and the bottom row are now compared, it can be seen that \textit{urb}, \textit{urf}, \textit{dlb} and \textit{drb} are back in their original position. The other four cubies (\textit{ulf}, \textit{ulb}, \textit{urf} and \textit{dlf}) have changed the positions: \\
\\
\hspace*{1.5cm } $\textit{ulb} \mapsto \textit{ulf}$ \hspace*{1.5cm }$\textit{ulf} \mapsto \textit{ulb}$ \hspace*{1.5cm } $\textit{dlf} \mapsto \textit{drf}$ \hspace*{1.5cm } $\textit{drf} \mapsto \textit{dlf}$
%\\
\\
The subsequent configuration is shown below, with $C=(1,0)$:
\begin{align*}
C \cdot [L, F] = (( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{ulf} ) \ (\textit{dlf} \ \textit{drf} ), (0,0,2,0,0,0 ,0,1) )
\end{align*}
This results in $C \cdot \lbrack L, F \rbrack = (( \ \textit{ulb} \ \textit{ulf} \ )(\ \textit{dlf} \ \textit{drf} \ ), (0 ,0,2,0,0,0,0,1) )$ in cycle notation.
So,  two pairs of cubies have swapped positions and changed their orientation. 
\end{example}
In comparison, for example, for the commutator of $\lbrack L, R \rbrack$, no cubie positions are changed because $L$ and $R$ do not affect any other cubies.


\subsection{Solutions}
\label{Section_Solutions}


There are different ways by which we can solve the cube. Usually, the layers of the cube are solved one after the other.
The colour of the first layer is not relevant for the solution algorithms. However, people often start with white because the arrangement of the colours is easier to remember. Then, we can see more quickly which layer a cubie belongs to.

The two approaches described are not the shortest possible solution. More about the optimal solution can be found at the end of section \ref{Section_SolutionExample} and in section \ref{Section_MinSolution}. 

\subsubsection{Completely Solve Layers One after the Other}

With this approach, the two layers of the cube are solved one after the other. To do this, first, the first layer and then the second layer are completely solved. This means that both the alignment and position of the cubies must be correct. The first layer can be solved using simpler moves than the second layer. The reason for this is that the arrangement of the cubies on the second layer is not yet relevant when solving the first layer. When solving the second layer, more complex moves must be executed to maintain the solved state of the first layer.

The solution method for the second layer involves first aligning all the tiles on the layer. Then, all $x_i=0$. The positions are then swapped. The cube configuration is finally $(1,0)$ and the cube is solved.

This layer-by-layer procedure is usually used with the \Tthree cube and now we'll try to use this method in case of the \Ttwo cube: With the \Tthree cube, the upper layer is solved first, then the middle one, followed by the lower one. If this procedure is applied to the \Ttwo cube, all those solution steps that affect the edges can be ignored, since the \Ttwo cube has no edge cubies. In addition, there is no middle layer and the corresponding solution steps of the \Tthree cube are also not required for the \Ttwo cube.

This approach is also called \textit{Fridrich method named after Jessica Fridrich, who invented this method}  or \textit{CFOP method}. 
\footnote{The abbreviation \textit{CFOP} refers to solving the \Tthree cubes and stands for: \textit{Cross}, \textit{First 2 Layes [$F2L$]}, \textit{Orient Last Layer (OLL)} and \textit{Permute Last Layer (PLL)}. \cite{DDJT}}  \cite{DDJT,fridrich1997}.
This method is carried out and have been explained step by step using an example in section \ref{Section_SolutionExample}. In addition, the algorithms for the two layers are described in the sections \ref{Section_AlgorithmsFirstlayer} and \ref{Section_AlgorithmsSecondlayer}. 

\subsubsection{Align the Cubies and then Position them}

With this approach, all the cubies on the first layer are first aligned correctly. There is ,then, a white side that consists of four white colour areas. However, the position of the cubies is not relevant. Then all the cubies on the second layer are aligned. Here also, the position is not relevant. There is then a white and a yellow side. However, the other four sides have not been solved because the cubie positions have not yet been taken into account.
If all the cubies are correctly aligned and the vector $x=0$, they are swapped with each other and the cube is thus solved. This procedure is called \textit{Ortega method}.

\subsection{Solution of the Cube using an Example}

\label{Section_SolutionExample}
I'll now delve into discussions of solving the cube using the CFOP method (whose procedure for the solution method was described in \ref{Section_Solutions}. Here, we'll use the knowledge of the CFOP method of solving \Tthree cube in \Ttwo cube.  The descriptions of the algorithms of this solution method can be found in the sections \ref{Section_AlgorithmsFirstlayer} and \ref{Section_AlgorithmsSecondlayer}.


To solve the cube, moves that only affect a few cubies are useful. This means that specific cubies can then be turned or swapped. In order to specifically influence individual cubies, more complex algorithms are necessary. Therefore, the algorithms in this example become longer as the cube approaches the solved state.


In this example, the cube is rotated with the move $\textit{FUBR}F^{-1}$ (see figure \ref{Figure_SolutionHuman0}). Now, I'll explain how to  solve the cube manually using the CFOP  method. The cube is initially in the configuration $C = ((\textit{ulf} \ \textit{dlf} \ \textit{dlb} \ \textit{urf}),(2,2,0,0,2, 2,1,0))$.
In the following figures, the cube was rotated by $90^\circ$ around the $z$ axis. The configuration is, therefore, another cube configuration equivalent to $C$ : $C'=(( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{urb} \ \textit{urf}) \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{dlb} ) \ (\textit{drb} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{dlf}),$ $(0,2,0,2,1,2,0,2))$.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.13]{LURFL1.png}
\caption{Cube after move $\textit{FUBR}F^{-1}$ }
\label{Figure_SolutionHuman0}
\end{figure}

The first step in this approach of solving the cube is to arrange the cubies on the upper layer so that the coloured areas are all white and the four upper cubies are in the correct position relative to each other.
To solve the upper layer, $x_{1-4} = (0,0,0,0)$,  the cubies of the layer must be in the correct position relative to each other.

To do this, the person solving the puzzle looks for cubies with white coloured areas and finds the white-orange-blue cubies at the position \textit{urf}.
With the move $F^{-1}$ the cubies find its place in the upper layer with the white coloured area at the top.
Now $x_{1-4}''=(0,2,0,1)$. The cube is shown in Figure \ref{Figure_SolutionHuman1}.  

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.16]{images/Step1.png}
\caption{Step 1}
\label{Figure_SolutionHuman1}
\end{figure}
There are now two cubies on the upper layer correctly aligned in the correct position - the white-orange-blue cubies and the white-red-blue cubies.
The new cube configuration is therefore $C'' $ $= C' \cdot F^{-1} $ $= ((\textit{ulb} \ \textit{urb} \ \textit{ulf} \ \textit{dlb} \ \textit{dlf} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{urb}),$ $(0,2,0,1,1,2,2,1))$.\\
The next cubies to be arranged here is the white-green-orange cubies. It is brought into position by the move $R^{-1}$ and finds its place next to the white-orange-blue cubies in the upper layer (figure \ref{Figure_SolutionHuman2}). The cube configuration $C'''$ is then $C'' \cdot R^{-1} = (( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{urf} ) \ ( \textit{drb} \ \textit{drf} ) \ ( \textit{urb} \ \textit{ulf} \ \textit{dlb} \ \textit{dlf}),(0,1,0,0,2,0,1,2))$.
 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.19]{images/Step2.png}
\caption{Step 2}
\label{Figure_SolutionHuman2}
\end{figure}

The last cubies with white coloured area are finally positioned by the move $RD^{-1}R^{-1}$. The upper layer is now solved and all cubies with white-coloured areas are aligned with each other as in the starting configuration (see figure \ref{Figure_SolutionHuman3}).
The cube configuration is $C^{IV}=(( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{urf} ) \ ( \textit{urb} \ \textit{ulf} ) \ ( \textit{drb} \ \textit{drf } \ \textit{dlf} ),(0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0))$.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.19]{Step3.png}
\caption{Step 3}
\label{Figure_SolutionHuman3}
\end{figure}

For the next step, we rotate the cube twice around the $y$ axis (\ref{Figure_SolutionHuman4}). The white side is now at the bottom and two of the four yellow areas are facing up. Then the cube configuration is $C^V $ $= (( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{urb} \ \textit{dlb} \ \textit{ulf} \ \textit{drf} ) \ ( \textit{urf} \ \textit{dlf} ),$ $(1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0))$. $C^V$ is equivalent to $C^{VI}$ because the cube was just rotated.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.19]{Step4.png}
\caption{Step 4}
\label{Figure_SolutionHuman4}
\end{figure}

Then, we perform the move $\textit{RUR}^{-1}U^{-1} R^{-1}\textit{FRF}^{-1}$  and get a solved Cube that is held upside down (\ref{Figure_SolutionHuman5}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.19]{Step5.png}
\caption{Step 5: Solved \textit{Cube} with white side down}
\label{Figure_SolutionHuman5}
\end{figure}

The cube configuration is $ C^{VI} = (( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{drb} ) \ ( \textit{urb} \ \textit{dlb} ) \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{drf } ) \ ( \textit{urf} \ \textit{dlf} ), (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))$. This configuration is equivalent to the configuration $(1,0)$.
Therefore, this cube is now rotated twice more around the $x$ axis and is finally in the configuration $C^{VII} =(1,0)$.
When solving the \textit{cube}, people follow certain combinations that can be used in different situations.
In this case, we performed $13$ face rotations, while the twisting required only five face rotations. As a result, we did not choose the shortest path, but rather a path that can be used in different cube configurations.
If the twist of the cube is inverted ($(\textit{FUBRF}^{-1})^{-1}$), this gives the combination $FR^{-1}B^{-1}U^{- 1}F^{-1}$ to solve the cube.
The question arises as to the maximum number of face rotations that may be required for the optimal solution. This number is also called \textit{God's Number} which is the maximum number of turns required to solve any scrambled cube. 

\subsubsection{God's Number}\label{God}
\begin{definition}
    A layer rotation rotates the layers by $90^\circ$ and rotation of $180^\circ$ is counted as two-quarter turns. This is called the \textbf{Quarter-Turn} metric.
\end{definition}

 \begin{definition}
    The face-turn metric counts that $180^\circ$
twist as only a single move is called \textbf{Half-Turn Metric}
 \end{definition}

Calculated according to the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric, the \textit{God's Number} of the \Ttwo cube is $14$ \cite{DJ}. In the \textit{Half-Turn} metric it is $11$ \cite{RMG, TR}.
I've discussed the process and the concepts for finding the optimal solution using the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric is in section \ref{Section_MinSolution}.

\subsection{Patterns}
In the section \textit{Pretty Patterns} \cite{TD}, Tom Davis showed eight \textit{pretty} patterns of the \Tthree cube. There is a very interesting discussion in the notes of David Singmaster \cite{singmaster1980notes} on this. So, being inspired by their works, I tried finding some pattern for \Ttwo cube. Here, in this part, I've discussed four patterns of the \Ttwo cube, and the associated algorithms starting from the starting configuration. These four patterns are shown in Figure \ref{Figure_Pattern}.
The configuration of the cube is also specified.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{RRFFRRUU.png} & \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{images/RFU-1RRUF-1RUFFRR.png} \\
Pattern 1 & Pattern 2 \\
$RR \ FF \, RR \ UU$ & $R \ F \, U^{-1} \, RR \ U \, F^{-1} \, R \ U \, FF \, RR$ \\

Pattern 3 & Pattern 4 \\
$UU \, FF \, RR \ UU$ & $U \, FF \, UU \, RR \ U$ \\
\end{tabular}

\caption{Pattern of the \Ttwo cube}
\label{Figure_Pattern}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Pattern 1} leaves the white and yellow sides unchanged and creates a checkered pattern on the other four sides. The colour pairs red-orange and green-blue are arranged together in a checkered pattern. The configuration of the cube is then $C = ((\textit{ulb} \ \textit{urf} ) \ ( \textit{drb} \ \textit{dlf} ),(0,0,0,0,0,0 ,0,0))$.

\textbf{Pattern 2} has a \textit{\textbf{cube within a cube}}. Two cubies that don't have a common colour area are swapped. The cube is then in the configuration $C = (( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{drf} ) \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{dlf} ) \ ( \textit{drb} \ \textit{ urb} ),(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))$.

\textbf{Pattern 3} shows alternating horizontal and vertical stripes on the different sides. The configuration of the cube is therefore $C = (( \textit{ulb} \ \textit{dlf} \ \textit{drb} ) \ ( \textit{urb} \ \textit{ulf} \ \textit{drf} )) ,(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))$.

\textbf{Pattern 4} arranges the colours like four columns. The white and yellow sides are checkered, and the other sides are striped. The configuration of the cube is $C = ( (\textit{urb} \ \textit{dlf} ) \ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{drb} ) ),(0,0,0,0,0,0 ,0,0))$.

\begin{note}
    These patterns are not common solution algorithms in most cases, but still, I worked a bit on this being inspired from \cite{TD}.
\end{note}


\subsection{Screwdriver Method}

The method that is often described as the simplest method for solving Rubik's cubes is the \textbf{Screwdriver Method}. \footnote{Various instructions for this method can be found on YouTube such as this \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OM39KfNazgr}.}.
With the usual \Ttwo cube, a screw can be seen on one or more sides in the middle between the cubies (see left in figure \ref{Figure_screwdriver method}).
To disassemble the cube, this screw must be loosened. The cubies can then be removed without any problems.
Then the cubies are rearranged and the cube can be reassembled in the solved configuration.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{screw.png}
\caption{Solution using screwdriver method}
\label{Figure_screwdriver method}
\end{figure}

\begin{note}
Taking into account the fact that the world record for the \Ttwo cube is $0.43$ seconds \cite{record, HugeCube}, the Screwdriver method is hardly the fastest.
\end{note}

\subsection{Algorithms for the First Layer}
\label{Section_AlgorithmsFirstlayer}
In this section, I'll try to describe algorithms for solving the first layer using CFOP method \cite{fridrich1997,ruwix_advanced_cfop_fridrich}. With this method, the first step is to correctly align the four cubies on the upper layer and arrange them correctly in relation to each other. The procedure for this method has already been described in section \ref{Section_Solutions}.

The CFOP method is a solution approach for the \Tthree cube, I'll try to apply our knowledge for \Tthree cube in  \Ttwo cube.\\
Since the \Ttwo cube, in contrast to the \Tthree cube, has no center cubies, a corner cubie can be assumed to be correct since the cube only has to be rotated to find a white-coloured area.\\
I'll follow the standard convention of starting with the white side. But this can be done by any other coloured side.
The \Tthree \textit{Cube} must be aligned according to the centre cubies and so it is predetermined which side will be the white side. \textbf{The white side must contain the white center cubie.}
But with the \Ttwo \textit{Cube}, we can start with any side. If we want to start with a specific side as the top that does not yet have a white colour, the colour area can be brought to this side by rotating a maximum of two layers.

In Figure \ref{Figure_FirstCornercubie} the first corner cubie of the upper layer is positioned. This can happen there either by the pull $R$ or a rotation around the $y$ axis.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.12]{e1_s1_s1.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.12]{e1_s1_s2.png}
\caption{Position first Corner Cubie}
\label{Figure_FirstCornercubie}
\end{figure}

Then, the second cubie can be added. For this algorithm, the white colour area of the second cubie must be on the side of the lower layer.
Ideally, the cubie is already in the desired, correct position by chance.
Otherwise, move $D$ is executed until the cubie is below its target position.  There, it is turned with $L, R, F$ or $R$ next to the existing first corner cubie that is already there. This can also be seen in Figure \ref{Figure_SecondCornercubie}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.14]{e1_s2_s1.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.14]{e1_s2_s2.png}
\caption{Position second Corner Cubie}
\label{Figure_SecondCornercubie}
\end{figure}
Orange and green colour areas are also shown.
This applies analogously to the other neighboring colour areas. 
\begin{note}
    The two colour areas on one side also have the same colour.
\end{note}
 If the white-coloured area of the corner is at the bottom of the cube, it can be twisted and placed in the position using the technique from Figure \ref{Figure_SecondCornercubie}. Then, the cubie with the white colour area is in the upper layer, but the white colour area is not aligned upwards. In this case, the cubie can be turned with one of the moves $L, R, F$ or $B$ and pushed to the lower layer with $U$. This process can be seen in Figure \ref{Figure_SecondCornercubie2}. The cubie is then correctly aligned using the technique described above in Figure (\ref{Figure_SecondCornercubie}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.16]{e1_s2_s1_s.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.16]{e1_s2_s2_s.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.16]{e1_s2_s3_s.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.16]{e1_s2_s4_s.png}
\caption{Second Corner Cubie: special case}
\label{Figure_SecondCornercubie2}
\end{figure}

The last two cubies of the first layer can also be positioned using the technique mentioned above. The upper layer is then solved. The vector entries $x_{1-4}$ are then $(0,0,0,0)$.
For the \Ttwo cube, solving the top layer corresponds to half of the cube. The algorithms for the second layer are discussed in section \ref{Section_AlgorithmsSecondlayer}.

\subsection{Algorithms for the Second Layer}
\label{Section_AlgorithmsSecondlayer}

When solving the second layer, care must be taken not to twist and disturb the first layer again. That's why the algorithms at this point are longer to move specific cubies.
In Figure \ref{Figure_SolvedUpperLayer} the upper layer of the cube is solved.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/layer.png}
\caption{Cube with Solved Upper Layer}
\label{Figure_SolvedUpperLayer}
\end{figure}

To solve the second layer, we usually turn the cube over so that the corresponding cubies are visible. For better clarity, this is also shown accordingly in the illustrations.

First, all the cubies on the second layer are aligned correctly so that the top side of the cube only shows yellow areas. The vector $x$ is then $0$. The cubies are then swapped until they are arranged correctly. For that, permutation function is $\sigma = 1$.

Since there are many possible cube configurations and algorithms for solving them, the possible cubie positions and algorithms are listed in a table. The algorithms all lead to a cube configuration in which the lower (already solved) layer remains unchanged and the upper side only shows yellow-coloured areas.
Many of these algorithms contain $(\textit{R U R}^{-1} U^{-1})$, which is written here as the commutator $[ R,U ]$. 



\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{m{4cm} m{6cm}}
\toprule
Starting Position & Algorithm  \\
\midrule
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/Upside-1.png} & $F \ [ R,U ] \  [ R,U ] \  [ R,U ] \ F^{-1}$ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/Upside-2.png} & $F \ [ R,U ] \ F^{-1}$ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.17]{images/Upside-3.png} & $F \ [ R,U ] \  [ R,U ] \ F^{-1}$ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/Upside-4.png} & $F^{-1} \ [ R,U ]\ L^{-1} \ U \ L$ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/Upside-5.png} & $[ R,U ] \ [R^{-1}, F]$ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/Upside-6.png} & $R \ U \ R^{-1} \ U \ R \ UU \ R^{-1}$ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/Upside-7.png} & $L^{-1} \ U^{-1} L \ U^{-1} \ L^{-1} \ UU \ L$ \\
\bottomrule

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

After executing these algorithms at the corresponding starting positions, the upper side of the cube only shows yellow - coloured areas. The alignment of the cubies is then already correct and the vector $x$ is therefore $(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$. If all the cubies on the second layer are already aligned correctly with each other, the layer may need to be correctly aligned with the first layer using $U$, $U^{-1}$ or $UU$. Otherwise, the cubie positions are swapped until they are correctly arranged.

There are various algorithms for swapping the cubies with each other without changing the alignment. These algorithms are listed in the table below. The arrows show which cubies go to which cube position when executing the algorithms.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{m{4cm} m{8cm}}
\toprule
Cubie Permutation & Algorithm \\
\midrule
\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{corners1.png} & $F \ R \ U^{-1} \ [R^{-1}, U^{-1}] \ R^{-1} \ F^ {-1} \ [R, U] [R^{-1}, F]$ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{corners2.png} & $[R,U] \ R^{-1} \ F \ RR \ U^{-1} \ [R^{-1}, U^{- 1}] \ R^{-1} \ F^{-1})$ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{corners3.png} & $R \ B^{-1} \ R \ FF \ R^{-1} \ B \ R \ FF \ RR $ \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



After executing the appropriate algorithms, both layers are solved. The two layers may still need to be correctly aligned with each other using $U$, $U^{-1}$ or $UU$. Finally, the cube is in the solved state and the cube configuration is therefore $(1,0)$.

Using this algorithm guide, any valid configuration of a \Ttwo cube can be converted into the starting configuration $(1,0)$.
\section{Minimal Group}
\label{Chapter_MinSubgroup}

In this section, I've analysed the group of the \Ttwo cube   with minimal moves. The group of $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ is the complete mapping of the \Ttwo cube -it is not minimal. We'll now define a minimal mapping and obviously, this minimal mapping is a subgroup of $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$.
The subgroup of the minimal mapping of the \Ttwo cube is defined as $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$. The set $G_{min}$ contains the equivalence classes of the minimum moves of the cube, creating the subgroup  $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$.


\subsection{Minimal Basics}
\label{Section_MinimalPermutations}
\label{Section_MinimalBasics}

The moves $U$, $D$, $R$, $L$, $F$ and $B$ of the \Ttwo cube are not minimal. For example, the moves $U$ and $D$ are equivalent to rotating the entire cube.
The set of minimal moves is $\{U, R, F\}$. None of these three basic moves can be represented by another move or a combination of other moves. The cubie \textit{dlb} (down, left, back) is not moved by any of these minimal moves. I've described this in detail in the definition of the minimum rotation of the cube (section \ref{section_minimum_rotation}).

\subsubsection{Minimal Permutations}

The permutations of these three basic moves are the permutation functions $\sigma$, which I've already been defined in Section \ref{Section_PositionsOfThecubiesInTheCube}. However, there are only three functions for the permutations instead of six since there are only three basic moves.
\begin{align*}
\sigma_U & =\ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{ulb} \ \textit{urb} \ \textit{urf} ) \\
\sigma_R & =\ ( \textit{urb} \ \textit{drb} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{urf} ) \\
\sigma_F & =\ ( \textit{ulf} \ \textit{urf} \ \textit{drf} \ \textit{dlf} )
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Minimum Alignment of the Cubies}
Now, I want to discuss the orientation of the cubies minimally which is done using an 8-dimensional vector $x$, which depicts the up and down of the cube and the coloured areas of the cubies located at that cubicle. The definition of the vector $x$ of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle* \right)$ can be found in section \ref{Section_AlignmentOfcubies}.

Since, the cubie at position \textit{dlb} is always assumed to be fixed in the minimal subgroup $(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*)$
\newpage
The change in vector entries can be fully covered by the following three functions.

\begin{align*}
& \gamma_U \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, 0, x_6, x_7, x_8 ) \right) = \left( x_3, x_1, x_4, x_2, 0, x_6, x_7, x_8 \right) \\
\\
& \gamma_R \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, 0, x_6, x_7, x_8 ) \right)  = \left( x_1, g(x_4), x_3, h(x_8), 0, h(x_2), x_7, g(x_6) \right) \\
\\
& \gamma_F \left( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, 0, x_6, x_7, x_8 ) \right) = \left( x_1, x_2, h(x_7), g(x_3), 0, x_6, g(x_8), h(x_4) \right) \\
\end{align*}

\subsection{Minimum Rotation of the Cube}
\label{section_minimum_rotation}
Since, the basic moves of the cube for the minimum mapping are the moves $U$, $R$ and $F$, the cubie at the down left back (\textit{dlb}) always remains unmoved. None of the minimal basic moves or a combination of them influences the cubie \textit{dlb}.
The cube therefore doesn't need to be rotated, as it has a fixed orientation based on the cubie \textit{dlb}. This cubie is highlighted in Figure \ref{Figure_DLB}, where the cube is shown from behind. This is the orange-green-yellow cubie. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.18]{DLB.png}
\caption{Highlighted in colour is the \textit{fixed} cubie \textit{dlb}}
\label{Figure_DLB}
\end{figure}

This means that no rotation of the cube is necessary for the minimal mapping of the \Ttwo cube, as the orientation of the cube can always be determined using the \textit{dlb} cubie.

%\subsection{Equivalence Relation of $G_{min}$}

%I've already defined the equivalence relation of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ in Section \ref{Section_EquivalenceRelationOfMoves}. This equivalence relation checks the equality of two moves with optional rotation. For the minimal subgroup that completely represents the cube, the rotation is not necessary because the orientation of the cube is determined using the cubie \textit{dlb}.

%The equivalence relation of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ is defined as $Z_1 \sim Z_2 :\Leftrightarrow \ C \cdot Z_1 = C \cdot WZ_2$ with $Z_1, Z_2 \in \Gtwo$, $C$ : cube configuration and $W$ : rotation. If the cube is not rotated, $W$ is the \textit{zero} rotation $I_R$. This then results in $Z_1 \sim_{min} Z_2 :\Leftrightarrow \ C \cdot Z_1 = C \cdot I_RZ_2$ for the minimal mapping. This can also be written as $Z_1 \sim_{min} Z_2 :\Leftrightarrow \ C \cdot Z_1 = C \cdot Z_2$.

%Since the equivalence relation $\sim_{min}$ of the group $\left(G_{min},  \scriptstyle*\right)$ is defined differently than that of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$. \\
%I'll also try to prove that \textbf{$\sim_{min}$ is an equivalence relation.}
%\begin{proofcustom}


%\textbf {Reflexivity} \ \\
%For reflexivity, $Z \sim_{min} Z$ must apply to all moves.


%\textbf{Symmetry} \ \\
%The following applies for symmetry: From $Z_1 \sim_{min} Z_2$ follows $Z_2 \sim_{min} Z_1$.



%\textbf {Transitivity} \ \\
%It must apply: From $Z_1 \sim_{min} Z_2$ and $Z_2 \sim_{min} Z_3$ it follows $Z_1 \sim_{min} Z_3$.

\subsection{Generator and Cayley Graph of $G_\text{min}$}
\label{section_CayleygraphMIN}

The subgroup $\left(G_\text{min}, \scriptstyle* \right)$ is generated by $\{U, R, F\}$. The complete Cayley graph of this subgroup has $3,647,160$ members. This is the number of valid cube configurations. Each equivalence class from $G_\text{min}$ stands for the moves that can be used to achieve a certain cube configuration. The generation of complete Cayley graph for such a huge subgroup is not possible for me because of my limitation of knowledge of GAP or other computational software. Still, I tried to show a part of this graph in Figure \ref{figure_Cayleygraph_min}. The red arrows represent the move $F$, $R$ is represented by blue, and $U$ by green.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{Cayleygraph_URF.png}
\caption{Cayley Graph of the subgroup $G_{min}$}
\label{figure_Cayleygraph_min}
\end{figure}

At node $FFF$, we can see that the arrow leads back to $N$ when adding another $F$. This is because $FFFF$ and $N$ are from the same equivalence class and represent the same move. If the complete graph had been generated, this cyclic nature of the moves could be seen more frequently.
\newpage
\subsection{Equivalence of the Groups}

Now, we'll try to prove: 
\begin{proposition}
    

\textbf{$\Gtwo$ and $G_{min}$ are of equal order and therefore both are a complete map of the \Ttwo cube.}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proofcustom}
    

To do this,  we'll first try to show that the moves of the minimal subgroup $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$ are sufficient to represent all moves of the cube. The elements of the sets $\Gtwo$ and $G_{min}$ are the equivalence classes of the moves. The elements of the set $\Gtwo$ consists of the basic moves $U, D, R, L, F$ and $B$. The rotations of the cube are not considered as moves, here, because the equivalence classes consider the equality of two cube configurations with rotation.
Each of the basic moves $U, D, R, L, F$ and $B$ of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ can be represented by one of the basics of the minimal group $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$. The cube can then be rotated differently, but this is compensated for by the equivalence classes, as they produce the equality of two moves with optional rotation. The following table shows the moves of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ and the corresponding minimal representatives of the subgroup $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c }
$\Gtwo$ & $U$ & $D$ & $R$  & $L$  & $F$  & $B$  \\
\midrule
$G_{min}$ & $U$ & $U$ & $R$  & $R$  & $F$  & $F$  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

So, every move from $\Gtwo$ can be represented with the moves from $G_{min}$. However, the orientation of the cube must be taken into account. For example, the move \textit{ULF} on the group $(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*)$ generates an equivalent cube configuration as the move \textit{URU} on the subgroup $(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*)$. Because the move rotates differently after executing move $L$ or $R$, the following move changes.

For example, if move $L$ is executed and transferred to move $R$ to correspond to the minimum mapping, the following moves must be changed accordingly. For the move $L$, the following moves are changed as follows:
\begin{align*}
\rho_L(U) = B \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \rho_L(D) = F \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \   \rho_L(R) = R \\
\rho_L(L) = L \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \rho_L(F) = U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \rho_L(B) = D 
\end{align*}

For the moves $U, R, F$, the following moves remain unchanged because these moves are identical in both groups. For moves $D, L, B$, the subsequent moves are changed based on the direction of the cube. This results in the transfer of the move \textit{ULF} of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ into the move \textit{URU} of the minimal subgroup $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$:
\begin{align*}
U \ L \ F \Rightarrow U \ R \ \rho_L(F) \Rightarrow U \ R \ U
\end{align*}

The transfer functions of all basic moves are defined below:

\begin{alignat*}{3}
 & \rho_D(U) = U \qquad \qquad  && \rho_D(D) = D  \qquad \qquad && \rho_D(R) = F  \\
 & \rho_D(L) = B    && \rho_D(F) = L    && \rho_D(B) =  R \\
\\
 & \rho_L(U) = B  && \rho_L(D) = F  && \rho_L(R) = R \\
 & \rho_L(L) = L  && \rho_L(F) = U  && \rho_L(B) = D  \\
\\
 & \rho_B(U) = R && \rho_B(D) = L   && \rho_B(R) = D \\
 & \rho_B(L) = U  && \rho_B(F) =  F && \rho_B(B) = B  \\
\end{alignat*}
Using these functions, all moves in the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ can be converted into moves in the minimal group $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$. The functions $\rho$ are applied to all elements that are to be executed after the corresponding move. They can also be nested ( it means that these functions can be applied recursively to the results of other functions.). For better clarity, we'll take the help of an example: 
\begin{example}
 
\begin{align*}
& U \ R \ F \ \textbf{\textit{B}} \ R \ L \ F  \\ 
\Rightarrow \ & U \ R \ F \ F \ \rho_B(R) \ \rho_B(L) \ \rho_B(F) \\
\Rightarrow \ & U \ R \ F \ F \ \textbf{\textit{D}} \ U \ F \\
\Rightarrow \ & U \ R \ F \ F \ U \ \rho_D(U) \ \rho_D(F) \\
\Rightarrow  \ & U \ R \ F \ F \ U \ U \ \textbf{\textit{L}} \\
\Rightarrow \ & U \ R \ F \ F \ U \ U \ R
\end{align*}
\end{example}
Thus, every move of the group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ can be represented by the minimal moves of the subgroup $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$. The cardinality of $G_{min}$ is, therefore, at least as large as that of $\Gtwo$. But it cannot be larger because $\Gtwo$ contains exactly the number of possible moves that are not equal due to the equivalence classes. Since, $(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*)$ is a subgroup of $(\Gtwo, \circ)$ , $G_{min}$ can contain a maximum of as many elements as $\Gtwo$.

Consequently, $G_{min}$ also contains the equivalence classes of all possible moves and is a complete map of the \Ttwo cube.
\end{proofcustom}

\subsection{Minimal Solution Path}
\label{Section_MinSolution}
In this section, I tried finding the optimal solution path starting from any cube configuration. To do this, different trees [This has been discussed in Appendix \ref{DSA}] are modeled and compared. To calculate the maximum size of these trees, the \textit{God's Number} is used.

The \textit{God's Number} \cite{RMG,TR, godsnumber,Godgrol} of the cube tells us the maximum number of moves needed to solve the cube. It has already been described at the end of section \ref{Section_SolutionExample}. With the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric, the \textit{God's Number} is then 14 \cite{DJ} and with the \textit{Half-Turn} metric, the \textit{God's Number} is only 11 \cite{MMFAA}.
The search for the optimal solution, starting from an arbitrary configuration $C$, can be done using a tree. To make this efficient, the tree should be as small as possible. 



A tree for computing the optimal solution contains an arbitrary configuration $C$ as the root. Starting from this starting node, there is an edge for every possible move of the cube. These edges each lead to a resulting configuration $C_i$, where the index $i$ contains the previous moves of the path in the tree. So, every node $C_i$ is followed by a node $C_{iZ}$ in the next level over an edge of a move $Z$. The path $i$ in the tree leads to a node with the configuration $C_i=(1,0)$, which represents a solution. To determine the length of a path, the number of face rotations in index $i$ must be determined. This number is referred to below as $|i|$. A configuration $C_i$ is reached after $|i|$ moves. This allows us to find out the length of the optimal solution path.

The group $(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*)$ is created by the moves $U, D, R, L, F$ and $B$. However, since these moves are not minimal, three of these moves are sufficient for the edges of a tree: $U, R$ and $F$. These three moves create the subgroup $(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*)$. Thus, the minimal tree can be formed starting from this subgroup, since it (just like $(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*)$) represents the entire cube [section \ref{Section_CardinalityOfG}].

Considering every possible move for the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric, we get six moves since each face can be rotated in two directions. These are the moves $F, F^{-1}, R, R^{-1}, U$ and $U^{-1}$.

Starting from each configuration $C_i$, the tree then looks like this: \nopagebreak

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.8]{Tree_1.jpg}
\caption{Solution tree: \textit{Quarter-Turn}-Metric}
\label{Figure_TreeQTM}
\end{figure}
Each tree node therefore has six children. Since the \textit{God's Number} in the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric is 14, the cube is solved after 14 quarter turns. The cube configuration is then $C_i = (1, 0)$ with $|i| \leq 14$. $|i|$ corresponds to the depth of the tree. Accordingly, the tree has a maximum size of $6^{14} = 78, 36,41,64, 096$ nodes.

For a tree with a minimum number of children, the edges $F^{-1}, R^{-1}$ and $U^{-1}$ are omitted. These moves can be represented by $FFF, RRR$ and $UUU$. Each node then only has three children.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Tree_2.jpg}
\caption{Solution tree with Minimal Edges}
\label{Figure_TreeMin}
\end{figure}

However, the moves $F^{-1}, R^{-1}$ and $U^{-1}$ are each represented by three edges. This results in a maximum depth of $|i| = 14 \cdot 3 = 42$. The maximum size of the tree is therefore $3^{42} = 109\ 418\ 989\ 131\ 512\ 359\ 209$.

Accordingly, the tree with the minimum number of children is significantly larger than the tree of the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric described above. The \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric tree is more suitable for calculating the optimal solution path, as it can be calculated more efficiently due to its lower number of nodes.

Based on the \textit{Half-Turn} metric, a different tree is created. There are then more possible plane rotations: $F, FF, F^{-1}, R, RR, R^{-1}, U, UU$ and $U^{-1}$. This is what the tree looks like starting from each configuration $C_i$:

In the tree \textit{Half-Turn} metric, each node has 9 children. Since the \textit{God's Number} in the \textit{Half-Turn} metric is 11, the tree has a maximum depth of 11. The maximum size of the tree is then $9^{11} = 31,38,10,59, 609 $. The tree of the \textit{Half-Turn} metric is therefore smaller than the tree of the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric.

The calculation of the optimal solution in the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric can also be implemented using the tree of the \textit{Half-Turn} metric. The tree is then smaller than the tree of the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric described above. The modified tree has 9 children per node. However, for the edges with half rotations ($FF, UU$, and $RR$), the index of the resulting configuration is incremented by two instead of 1. This means that the optimal solution path in the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric can be calculated with this tree and the size of the tree is a maximum of $9^{11} =31,38,10,59,609$.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.3]{Tree_3.jpg}
\caption{Optimized Solution Tree: \textit{Half-Turn} Metric}
\label{Figure_TreeQTM_min}
\end{figure}

However, when searching for the optimal path, one must look for the configuration $C_i=(1,0)$ with the smallest value for $i$, since the tree level of the node in the modified tree says nothing about the number of moves.
Since, the tree of the \textit{Half-Turn} metric is smaller than the tree of the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric, the length of the optimal solution of the \textit{Quarter-Turn} metric can also be read more efficiently from the modified one. 


\section{Conclusions}

\label{Chapter_Conclusion}
\subsection*{Summary and Result}
In this work, the group theoretic knowledge and understanding  of the \Tthree cube has been applied to the \Ttwo cube. The \Ttwo cube stands out from the \Tthree cube primarily because of the rotation possibilities due to the missing center cubies. 

The group $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ of the \Ttwo cube consists of the set of moves ($\Gtwo$) and the operator $\scriptstyle*$ which connects two moves. The set $\Gtwo$ contains the equivalence classes of all moves and thus equivalent moves are represented by only one element. This also includes the rotation possibilities of the cube.
Since each of the cube configurations is reachable by a different move and the set $\Gtwo$ contains equivalent moves together in an equivalence class, the cardinality of $\Gtwo$ corresponds to the number of valid cube configurations. There are $3, 674, 160$ valid cube configurations on the \Ttwo cube.

In addition, the minimal subgroup $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$ of $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ was formed, which completely represents the cube. This subgroup is less complex than $\left(\Gtwo, \scriptstyle*\right)$ because it is limited to three basic moves. This means, there is a \textit{solid} cubie with which the orientation of the cube can be determined and the rotations no longer have to be taken into account.

Furthermore, various approaches to solving the cube were described and the \textit{God's Number} was discussed. This describes the maximum number of moves to optimally solve the cube.  and is $14$ For the \Ttwo cube, it is $11$ using the half- turn metric and $14$ moves using the quarter-turn metric . A tree structure was then designed to find an optimal solution which is based on the minimal, group-theoretic mapping of the cube $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$.

The group of the \Ttwo cube illustrates group theory with various concepts such as subgroups, generators, cyclic groups, Cayley graphs, group operations, commutators, equivalence relations, cardinality of a group, ordering of group elements, permutations, and cycles. It's very interesting to mention Hofstadter's point \cite{Hofstader} here : "\textit{It is this kind of marvelously concrete illustration of an abstract notion of group theory that makes the Magic Cube one of the most amazing things ever invented for teaching mathematical ideas.}"


\subsection*{Outlook}

In this work, among other things, generators and their Cayley graphs were described. In the course of this, a minimal, complete mapping of the \Ttwo cube was generated, the group $\left(G_{min}, \scriptstyle*\right)$. The generation of the Cayley graph of this complete mapping would show the cyclic behaviour of the moves, which was discussed in the work in Section \ref{Section_Ordermoves}.  


The definition of the equality of two moves and the equivalence classes of moves lead to the problem of calculating the equality of any two distinct moves.

In addition, commutators were discussed in this work. To obtain meaningful results on the commutativity of move pairs, a larger number of commutators would have to be calculated and compared. 


Based on the group theory model of the \Ttwo cube, a \textit{GUI} (\textit{Graphical User Interface}) could be implemented for solving the cube. The optimal solution could be understood and analyzed with the tree structure as described in the paper. In this way, efficient algorithms could be found through experiments and different solutions to the cube could be compared and optimized \cite{article,kaurstudy}.
