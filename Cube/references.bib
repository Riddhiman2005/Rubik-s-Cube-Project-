    abstract = { We give an expository account of our computational proof that every position of Rubik's Cube can be solved in 20 moves or less, where a move is defined as any twist of any face. The roughly \$4.3 \times 10^{19}\$ positions are partitioned into about two billion cosets of a specially chosen subgroup, and the count of cosets required to be treated is reduced by considering symmetry. The reduced space is searched with a program capable of solving one billion positions per second, using about one billion seconds of CPU time donated by Google. As a byproduct of determining that the diameter is 20, we also find the exact count of cube positions at distance 15. }

abstract = {Combinatorics has been rather neglected by historians of mathematics. Yet there are good reasons for studying the origins of the subject, since it is a kind of mathematical subculture, not exactly parallel in its development with the great disciplines of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. This article is concerned, not with the recent history of the subject, but with its roots, before it became an identifiable branch of mathematics with its own definitions and theorems. Roughly speaking, this means that the period unde discussion ends around 1650 A.D.
Résumé
L'analyse combinatoire a reçu peu d'attention de la part des historiens des mathématiques. Mais il y a de bonnes raisons pour étudier les origines du sujet, parce que c'est une espèce de sours-culture mathématique, pas exactement parallèle en développement aux trois grandes disciplines, l'arithmétique, l'algèbre, et la géométrie. Cet article ne s'occupe pas de l'histoire récente du sujet, mais plutôt des ses racines, avant qu'il soit devenu une branche identifiable des mathématiques, avec les définitions et les théorèmes particulières à elle-même. Cela veut dire que la periode dont il s'agit ici se termine vers l'année 1650 A.D.}

 abstract = {A difficult problem in computer cubing is to find positions that are hard—positions that are as far from solved as possible. An effective way to find such positions is to examine positions exhibiting symmetry; empirically, we see that hard positions have a higher frequency in the subset of positions exhibiting symmetry than in general. While there are many symmetric positions, they are a small fraction of all positions and belong to a few large subgroups, which enables us to solve them effectively with a coset solver.},
